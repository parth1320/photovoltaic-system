# Photovoltaic Electricity Planning Project

This project is a web application developed to help users plan their photovoltaic electricity systems. Users can create, update, and delete projects, define multiple photovoltaic products, and choose between different predefined photovoltaic system products. The application provides a visual map where users can view and manage the locations of their photovoltaic products.
