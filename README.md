# Photovoltaic Electricity Planning Project

This project is a web application developed to help users plan their photovoltaic electricity systems. Users can create, update, and delete projects, define multiple photovoltaic products, and choose between different predefined photovoltaic system products. The application provides a visual map where users can view and manage the locations of their photovoltaic products.

### Explanation of the ToC Linking

1. **Section Titles**: Ensure each section title is unique and accurately reflects the content.
2. **ToC Links**: The links in the ToC use the format `[Link Text](#lowercased-title-with-hyphens)`. This format converts spaces to hyphens and converts the text to lowercase.
3. **Special Characters**: If your section titles contain special characters, they should be omitted or replaced in the link format. For example, "API Endpoints" becomes `#api-endpoints`.

This structure ensures that the links in the Table of Contents navigate correctly to the respective sections in your README.
